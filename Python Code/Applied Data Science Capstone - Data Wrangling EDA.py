# # **Space X  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction**
# 

# ## Lab 2: Data wrangling
# 

# Estimated time needed: **60** minutes
# 

# In this lab, we will perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.
# 
# In the data set, there are several different cases where the booster did not land successfully. Sometimes a landing was attempted but failed due to an accident; for example, <code>True Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a specific region of the ocean while <code>False Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a specific region of the ocean. <code>True RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a ground pad <code>False RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a ground pad.<code>True ASDS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully landed on  a drone ship <code>False ASDS</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed on a drone ship.
# 
# In this lab we will mainly convert those outcomes into Training Labels with `1` means the booster successfully landed `0` means it was unsuccessful.
# 

# Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully

# ## Import Libraries and Define Auxiliary Functions
# 

# We will import the following libraries.
# 

# In[1]:


# Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
import pandas as pd
#NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
import numpy as np


# ### Data Analysis
# 

# Load Space X dataset, from last section.
# 

# In[2]:


df=pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datasets/dataset_part_1.csv")
df.head(10)


# Identify and calculate the percentage of the missing values in each attribute
# 

# In[3]:


df.isnull().sum()/df.count()*100


# Identify which columns are numerical and categorical:

df.dtypes


# ### TASK 1: Calculate the number of launches on each site
# 
# The data contains several Space X  launch facilities: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cape_Canaveral_and_Merritt_Island_launch_sites?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDS0321ENSkillsNetwork26802033-2022-01-01'>Cape Canaveral Space</a> Launch Complex 40  <b>VAFB SLC 4E </b> , Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 4E <b>(SLC-4E)</b>, Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A <b>KSC LC 39A </b>.The location of each Launch Is placed in the column <code>LaunchSite</code>
# 

# Next, let's see the number of launches for each site.
# 
# Use the method  <code>value_counts()</code> on the column <code>LaunchSite</code> to determine the number of launches  on each site:
# 

# In[5]:


# Apply value_counts() on column LaunchSite
df['LaunchSite'].value_counts()


# Each launch aims to an dedicated orbit, and here are some common orbit types:
# 

# *   <b>LEO</b>: Low Earth orbit (LEO)is an Earth-centred orbit with an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less (approximately one-third of the radius of Earth),\[1] or with at least 11.25 periods per day (an orbital period of 128 minutes or less) and an eccentricity less than 0.25.\[2] Most of the manmade objects in outer space are in LEO <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDS0321ENSkillsNetwork26802033-2022-01-01'>\[1]</a>.
# 
# *   <b>VLEO</b>: Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO) can be defined as the orbits with a mean altitude below 450 km. Operating in these orbits can provide a number of benefits to Earth observation spacecraft as the spacecraft operates closer to the observation<a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271499606_Very_Low_Earth_Orbit_mission_concepts_for_Earth_Observation_Benefits_and_challenges?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDS0321ENSkillsNetwork26802033-2022-01-01'>\[2]</a>.
# 
# *   <b>GTO</b> A geosynchronous orbit is a high Earth orbit that allows satellites to match Earth's rotation. Located at 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) above Earth's equator, this position is a valuable spot for monitoring weather, communications and surveillance. Because the satellite orbits at the same speed that the Earth is turning, the satellite seems to stay in place over a single longitude, though it may drift north to south,‚Äù NASA wrote on its Earth Observatory website <a  href="https://www.space.com/29222-geosynchronous-orbit.html?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDS0321ENSkillsNetwork26802033-2022-01-01" >\[3] </a>.

# ### TASK 2: Calculate the number and occurrence of each orbit
# 

# Use the method  <code>.value_counts()</code> to determine the number and occurrence of each orbit in the  column <code>Orbit</code>
# 

# In[6]:


# Apply value_counts on Orbit column
df['Orbit'].value_counts()


# ### TASK 3: Calculate the number and occurence of mission outcome per orbit type
# 

# Use the method <code>.value_counts()</code> on the column <code>Outcome</code> to determine the number of <code>landing_outcomes</code>.Then assign it to a variable landing_outcomes.

# In[9]:


# landing_outcomes = values on Outcome column
landing_outcomes = df['Outcome'].value_counts()

# 

# In[10]:


for i,outcome in enumerate(landing_outcomes.keys()):
    print(i,outcome)


# We create a set of outcomes where the second stage did not land successfully:
#

bad_outcomes=set(landing_outcomes.keys()[[1,3,5,6,7]])
bad_outcomes


# ### TASK 4: Create a landing outcome label from Outcome column
# 

# Using the <code>Outcome</code>,  create a list where the element is zero if the corresponding  row  in  <code>Outcome</code> is in the set <code>bad_outcome</code>; otherwise, it's one. Then assign it to the variable <code>landing_class</code>:
# 

# In[14]:


# landing_class = 0 if bad_outcome
# landing_class = 1 otherwise
landing_class = []
for key, value in df['Outcome'].items():
    if value in bad_outcomes:
        landing_class.append(0)
